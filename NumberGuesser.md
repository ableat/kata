# Number Guesser

## Goal

You're going to write a game where the player has to guess a random number chosen by the computer. The program will ask for a guess and then tell the player if they are correct, or if their guess was too high or too low.

Below is an example of the possible output for the game:

```
Hello! What is your name? Bob
Hello Bob - I am thinking of a number between 1 and 10.
What is your guess? 2
That's too low Bob.
What is your guess? 5
That's too high Bob.
What is your guess? 4
You are correct Bob! You didn't cheat did you?
```
